# Pad-Holder 
This is a web application for Boxers, Kickboxers, MMA fighters, or anyone looking to increase their reaction time while doing bagwork or shadow boxing. There is no replacement for a great coach yet but the Pad-Holder app is the best attempt as a web application that creates some of a coach's characteristics. This application includes a round timer and uses speech synthesis to call out classic fight combinations during the rounds!
